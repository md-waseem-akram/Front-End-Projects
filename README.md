This repository contains Front end projects

Creating a simple Todo list with vanilla JS with below features

   1. A minimal design with HTML and CSS (no libraries, no frameworks).
   2. A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
   3. Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.
   4. A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.
   5. A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items)
   6. Total number of tasks in the list.
